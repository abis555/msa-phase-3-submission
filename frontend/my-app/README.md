# Frontend Submission

This is the frontend submission for NZMSA phase 2. It is a single page application that allows users to search for movies from Studio Ghibli. It is built using React. The API that is being used in this frontend is the [Studio Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/). All the credits for the information goes to Studio Ghibli. In order to search for movies, the user must enter a title. The user can then click on the search icon to see the details of the movie. 

The details of the movie is mainly consist of title, description, director, release year, running time, rotten tomato score and the poster. When user searching for a movie, the user needs to enter the title of the movie as accurately as possible as if entered incorrectly, the search will not return any results. The example can be seen below.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
