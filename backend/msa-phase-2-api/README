# Backend Submission

This is the backend submission for NZMSA phase 2. It is a Pokemon Team Api that a user can make different teams with three of their favorite pokemons. The teams are stored in local in-memory caching service. There are in total of six different APIs designed to give all the services to the user in order to make their Pokemon teams.

When user want to change one of their pokemons to their favorite ones, user need to refer to [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/) as there are some pokemons that are not present in this API. For this submission, Pokeapi was used as 3rd party API, in order, to meet the requirements for the submission.
