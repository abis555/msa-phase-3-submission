# msa-phase-2-submission

This is the NZMSA phase 2 submission for Ajay Bisht. For phase 2, I have decided to choose frontend and backend for submission. 

For frontend submission, I have designed a Studio Ghibli Movie Search Application using React, whereas for backend submission, I have designed a Pokemon Team Maker using .Net C#.
